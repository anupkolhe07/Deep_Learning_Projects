MNIST Image Classification with Neural Networks

Overview:

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) along with their corresponding labels. In this project, TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and train a neural network model to classify these digits.

Usage:

To use this code:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
Install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the mnist_neural_network.py script to train the model and evaluate its performance. After training, the script will display the test accuracy of the trained model in the terminal.
