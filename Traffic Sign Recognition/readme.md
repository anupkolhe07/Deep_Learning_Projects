# Traffic Signs Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for recognizing traffic signs using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify different types of traffic signs commonly found on roads.

## Features

- Implemented a CNN architecture with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Utilized data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data and improve model performance.
- Employed the Early Stopping callback to halt training when the model's performance on a validation dataset stops improving, thus preventing overfitting.
- Achieved impressive results with a training accuracy of 97.96% and a validation accuracy of 97.86%.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Results

The trained model achieved a training accuracy of 97.96% and a validation accuracy of 97.86%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing traffic signs.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need for accurate and efficient traffic sign recognition systems to enhance road safety.
